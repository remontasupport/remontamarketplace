# AI-DLC State Tracking

## Project Information
- **Project**: New backend system — NestJS service (`apps/api`) for the existing Remonta product
- **Project Type**: Brownfield — a new service alongside `apps/app`, sharing its database and auth, with domains moved over incrementally (strangler)
- **Start Date**: 2026-09-24T13:53:59+05:30
- **Current Stage**: CONSTRUCTION - Slice 1 Worker Registration, CODE GENERATION on branch `s1/worker-registration`. Plan: aidlc-docs/construction/plans/S1-code-generation-plan.md (approved). Step 1 committed (08e37a2) and verified on local PostGIS 2026-09-25 (forward, 27 constraint probes, all down.sql, exact reversal, re-apply). Next: step 2 needs the G-NAF download (folder from user); step 3 (contract package) can start meanwhile.

## Workspace State
- **Existing Code**: Yes
- **Programming Languages**: TypeScript
- **Build System**: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- **Project Structure**: Monorepo — `apps/app` (Next.js application), `apps/web` (Next.js marketing site), `packages/{config,schemas,db}` (Prisma over Neon Postgres, Sydney)
- **Workspace Root**: C:\Users\toton\Desktop\Remonta
- **Reverse Engineering Needed**: Refresh only — the backend shares `apps/app`'s database and auth
  - Business view: `.brd/phase-0` … `phase-8` (2026-09-23) — scope agreed in Clarification 11
  - Technical view: prior-cycle artifacts in `aidlc-docs/archive/monorepo-migration/inception/reverse-engineering/`
  - Decided at Workflow Planning: targeted refresh of the in-scope domains (done 2026-09-25)

## Code Location Rules
- **Application Code**: Workspace root (NEVER in aidlc-docs/)
- **Documentation**: aidlc-docs/ only
- **Structure patterns**: See code-generation.md Critical Rules

## Previous Cycle
- The previous AI-DLC cycle (monorepo migration, U1–U8) is archived at `aidlc-docs/archive/monorepo-migration/` (Requirements Q20 = A; restored from git `HEAD`, 46 of 46 files).

## Extension Configuration
| Extension | Enabled | Decided At |
|---|---|---|
| Security Baseline | Yes (blocking) | Requirements Analysis |
| Resiliency Baseline | Yes (blocking) | Requirements Analysis |
| Property-Based Testing | Yes (full enforcement) | Requirements Analysis |
