## How to Test the Webhook

### Method 1: Test via Zoho CRM (Real-time Test)

1. **Go to Zoho CRM** → Contacts module

2. **Open any contractor contact**

3. **Edit any field** (e.g., phone number, city, etc.)

4. **Click Save**

5. **Zoho automatically triggers the webhook**
   - Your endpoint receives the contact ID
   - Fetches full contact data from Zoho
   - Syncs to your database
   - Updates `lastSyncedAt` timestamp

6. **Check your dev server logs** - You should see:
   ```
   [Webhook] Received Zoho webhook: { module: 'Contacts', operation: 'update', contactIds: [...] }
   [Webhook] Completed in XXXms - Success: 1, Failed: 0
   ```

---

### Method 2: Manual cURL Test

Test with a specific Zoho contact ID:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/zoho-contractor \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "module": "Contacts",
    "ids": ["87697000001553010"],
    "operation": "update"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Webhook processed",
  "operation": "update",
  "stats": {
    "total": 1,
    "success": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "duration": 3626
}
```

---

### Method 3: Health Check

Verify the endpoint is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/zoho-contractor
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Zoho Contractor Webhook endpoint is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T03:36:36.480Z"
}
```

## Webhook URL for Zoho Configuration

### Development (Local)
- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/zoho-contractor`
- **Note:** Use ngrok for local testing with Zoho webhooks

### Production (Vercel)
- **URL:** `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/webhooks/zoho-contractor`
- **Replace:** `your-domain.vercel.app` with your actual Vercel deployment URL

---

## Zoho Webhook Configuration

In your Zoho CRM Webhook settings, configure:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Notify URL** | `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/webhooks/zoho-contractor` |
| **Module** | `Contacts` |
| **Method** | `POST` |
| **Format** | `JSON` |
| **Workflow Rule** | Select your workflow rule or leave blank |

---

## Webhook Payload Structure

Zoho sends webhooks with this payload format:

```json
{
  "module": "Contacts",
  "ids": ["87697000001553010", "87697000001551001"],
  "operation": "insert" | "update" | "delete",
  "query_params": {},
  "token": "optional_security_token"
}
```

---

## What Happens When Webhook is Triggered

1. **Zoho sends webhook** → Your endpoint receives contact IDs
2. **Fetch full contact data** → Calls Zoho API to get complete contact details
3. **Transform data** → Parses names, booleans, integers, etc.
4. **Upload profile photo** → Downloads from Zoho and uploads to Vercel Blob (with retry logic)
5. **Upsert to database** → Creates or updates contractor record
6. **Return response** → Sends success/failure stats back to Zoho

---

## Monitoring Webhook Activity

### Check Sync Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sync-contractors \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYNC_API_SECRET"
```

**Response shows:**
- Total contractors in database
- Last synced timestamp
- Last synced contractor name
- 5 most recently synced records

---

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Triggering
- ✅ Check Zoho Workflow Rule is active
- ✅ Verify webhook URL is correct
- ✅ Ensure your server is running (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ Check Zoho webhook logs for errors

### Webhook Fails
- ✅ Check server logs for error messages
- ✅ Verify Zoho credentials are valid
- ✅ Check database connection
- ✅ Verify Vercel Blob credentials

### Data Not Syncing
- ✅ Check contact has required fields (firstName, lastName)
- ✅ Verify email uniqueness (no duplicates)
- ✅ Check Zoho field mappings are correct

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**
   - Deploy your app to Vercel
   - Update Zoho webhook URL to production URL
   - Test webhook in production

2. **Set Up Cron Job Backup** (Optional but recommended)
   - Create scheduled sync as backup
   - Runs every hour/day to catch any missed webhooks
   - Ensures data consistency

3. **Monitor Webhook Activity**
   - Set up logging/monitoring
   - Track webhook failures
   - Alert on sync errors

---
