    response = invokeurl
    [
        url: webhookUrl
        type: POST
        parameters: payload
        headers: headers
    ];

   - Contact Type: "Contractor"
   - Add any other fields you want

4. **Click "Save"**

5. **Wait 5-10 seconds**

6. **Check your database:**
   - If you're using Prisma Studio, refresh it
   - You should see "Test Contractor" appear!

‚úÖ **If it appears, your CREATE sync is working!**

---

### Test 2: Update a Contractor

1. **Open the "Test Contractor"** contact you just created

2. **Edit any field** (change phone number, add city, etc.)

3. **Click "Save"**

   - It should now have a date/time (marking it as deleted)
   - Your website won't show this contractor anymore because it's marked as deleted

‚úÖ **If it has a deletedAt date, your DELETE sync is working!**

---

## üéâ Congratulations!

Your Zoho to Database sync is now fully set up!

### What Happens Now?

**Every time you:**
- ‚úÖ **Create** a new contractor in Zoho ‚Üí Automatically added to database
- ‚úÖ **Edit** a contractor in Zoho ‚Üí Automatically updated in database
- ‚úÖ **Delete** a contractor in Zoho ‚Üí Automatically marked as deleted in database

### Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Data**: Try creating, editing, and deleting a few real contractors
2. **Monitor**: Check that data appears correctly on your website
3. **Go Live**: Once everything works, you're ready for production!

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Problem: Contractor doesn't appear in database

**Check:**
1. Is the workflow **Active** (green toggle)?
2. Did you wait 10 seconds after saving?
3. Did you set Contact Type = "Contractor"?
4. Check Zoho **Automation Logs** (Setup ‚Üí Automation ‚Üí Workflow Rules ‚Üí click on your workflow ‚Üí View Execution History)

**Solution:**
- Go to the workflow and check the execution logs
- Look for error messages
- Make sure the webhook URL is correct in your Deluge function

---

### Problem: Webhook URL error in Deluge function

**Error message:** "The endpoint your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev is offline"

**Solution:**
- You need to update the `webhookUrl` in both Deluge functions
- It should be your actual Vercel production URL
- Example: `https://mywebsite.vercel.app/api/webhooks/zoho-contractor`

---

### Problem: Data appears but profile photo doesn't upload

**This is normal!**
- Photo uploads can take a bit longer
- Refresh your database after 15-20 seconds
- If still not appearing, check that the contact has a photo in Zoho
